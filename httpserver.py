An HTTP server

Introduction: (Describe the lab in your own words) - LG
The goal of this lab was to implement an HTTP server, which is a program that listens for HTTP requests
and uses the information from that request to do something (usually responding with a webpage).
Our server will use a TCP socket to listen for requests and for sending responses, as per the HTTP protocol.
The webpages served will be stored on the hard drive in the same directory as the server, and the server will
use OS file IO operations to read the contents of those files for sending.
We broke the task into two parts: parsing the request and executing the response. You can see this design choice
in the implimentation: the handle_request function only calls two other functions with the two afformentioned purposes.

Summary: (Summarize your experience with the lab, what you learned, what you liked,what you disliked, and any suggestions you have for improvement) - EB
This lab taught me about the specific ways in which a server handles a client's request and responds accordingly
in order to return the appropriate data. Within handling client request, I learned how to determine where in the request
I needed to look for the resource, as well as specifics to correctly execute a protocol such as HTTP version and 
content-length header. When it came to sending the response, I learned the significance of dividing up tasks between 
methods to successfully build an accurate response. This was especially challenging when needing to validate input 
and return the correct status code. I liked this lab because it challenged me to not only split up tasks between 
methods, but consider where and how many times I am calling a function or parsing through the resource to ensure 
I was executing the response correctly and not over-calling a function. I have no specific recommendations for this lab.
